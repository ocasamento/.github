# Hey!

Getting married? Are you Portuguese? Were you looking to make your own website hosted on GitHub with a nice URL like https://ocasamento.github.io/your-name-and-your-significant-others-name?

Well, you're in luck. Unlike those name squatters like https://github.com/casamento, https://github.com/casamentos, https://github.com/vamoscasar, https://github.com/wedding and https://github.com/thewedding, I will create a repository for you if you just ask. Just send an email to guilherme.rdems@gmail.com.

It would be great if there was a way to report these name squatters, but unfortunately GitHub does not provide a way to do it.
